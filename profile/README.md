## Mission

We aim to create a community of Rust developers on campus for learning, teaching, and discussing the Rust programming language and its use in bioinformatics and anywhere else.

## What is this Github organisation for?

We will use this organisation to host repositories for the activities we set up. Currently we keep the slides from each meeting here; in the future we are considering hosting some study groups for the Rosalind problem set, in which case we would also keep the solutions here.
