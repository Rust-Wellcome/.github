## Mission

We aim to create a community of Rust developers on campus for learning, teaching, and discussing the Rust programming language and its use in bioinformatics and anywhere else.

## What is this Github organisation for?

We will use this organisation to host repositories for the activities we set up. Currently we plan to hold a series of study groups going through the [Rosalind problem set](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/) in Rust, and will push our solutions here.
